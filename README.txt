socket setup heavily referenced from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpAwggQJPUQ

npm init -y
npm i express socket.io
npm i --save-dev nodemon

to run the server:
npm run dev

will load up on localhost:3000, can be played from 2 separate tabs loaded into localhost:3000

i could not figure out the logic to make it so that a turn could only be played from whichever screen's turn it was.
